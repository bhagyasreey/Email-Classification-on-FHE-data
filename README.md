# Email-Classification-on-FHE-data

Area: Security, ML
Problem:Email classification involves analyzing user content, raising privacy concerns as emails may
contain sensitive or personal data. Traditional models require plaintext access, risking data exposure.
Tech: TenSeal
Results: The FHE-powered email classifier achieved comparable accuracy to plaintext models on spam
detection tasks. While inference time increased due to encryption overhead, data privacy was fully
preserved during classification, demonstrating the feasibility of secure and private email filtering
